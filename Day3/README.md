I came upon this problem on [Hacker Rank](hackerrank.com) in their [Interview prep warm up challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sock-merchant?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup).

The explicit problem had me a bit stumped so I initially thought through a simplified solution where we are working with a known number of pairs of socks.

If you are anything like me though you have an unknown number of different types of socks. Full disclosure I couldn't think of a solution in a reasonable time, so I took to Google-ing.

I found a solution to this on [Code Mentor](codementor.io), authored by [Marcos Rezende](https://www.codementor.io/@rezehnde) here (Sock Merchant Code Challenge Solved)[https://www.codementor.io/@rezehnde/sock-merchant-challenge-solved-in-c-10iz1059au].

If you are reading this then I highly recommend you read Marcos' original post.
